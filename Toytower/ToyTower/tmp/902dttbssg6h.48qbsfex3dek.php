      Toy Tower is a Canadian company that specializes in selling toys and games for children of all ages. 
      The company was founded in 1952 by Thomas Octavius Young, a young man with a passion for 
      toys and making children happy. Young started his business with a single store in Montreal, Quebec, 
      where he sold a variety of toys, from dolls and cars to puzzles and board games.

      Young’s vision was to create a place where children could explore their imagination and creativity, 
      and where parents could find the perfect gift for them. His vision was so powerful that
      his store soon became popular among the local community, as he offered quality products, friendly 
      service, and competitive prices. He also had a knack for finding and importing the latest and most 
      innovative toys from around the world, Toy Tower was the first store in North America to sell Lego!

        As the demand for his products grew, Young decided to expand his business and open more stores across 
        Canada. He also hired more staff, including his two nephews, Michael Pinsonneault and Zachary McRae, who 
        shared his enthusiasm and vision for the company. Together, they worked hard to maintain the high standards 
        and reputation of Toy Tower, and to keep up with the changing trends and preferences of their customers.
