- We created multiple headers because we had multiple stylesheets and they would conflict with each other otherwise.

- We have more controllers and templates then we need because it made it more simple for us to find things.


- Things we ran out of time to complete:
  - Admin Panel fully functional
  - Search Bar
  - My account
  - Validation for create account/login
